# Programming Concepts for Computer Science and Software Engineering

Welcome to **Programming Concepts for Computer Science and Software Engineering**!

This repository is a collection of notes, code examples, and exercises I created while studying core software engineering and computer science concepts.

## Why This Repo Exists

After years of learning programming languages directly, I realized that focusing solely on syntax wasn‚Äôt the most effective way to grow as a software engineer. I discovered that understanding **concepts** ‚Äî and applying those concepts using different languages ‚Äî is what builds true engineering skill.

This repo exists to:
- Document and deepen my understanding of foundational programming concepts.
- Compare implementations across multiple languages (C, C++, C#, Java, Python).
- Serve as a personal knowledge base and portfolio of my journey toward becoming a better software engineer.

Remember: **Programming languages are merely tools** ‚Äî it‚Äôs the underlying concepts and how we apply them that truly matter.

## üíª Languages Used

Concepts will be demonstrated in multiple programming languages to illustrate differences and similarities:

- **C** ‚Äì for low-level memory management and system programming.
- **C++** ‚Äì for object-oriented and systems-level concepts.
- **C#** ‚Äì for .NET-specific patterns and modern OOP features.
- **Java** ‚Äì for enterprise-level patterns and strong OOP.
- **Python** ‚Äì for rapid prototyping and scripting.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Software required to run the code in this repo:

- A C/C++ compiler: [mingw](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/). Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/-KayVZq1a58?si=jrnrxd5KkpQH5LK5) on how to install MinGW.
- Java Development Kit: [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk24-windows). Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/fuXTyRRge3s?si=E5j7YxRx9p8DZXxV) on how to install the JDK.
- .NET Software Development Kit (for C#): [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download). Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/onxL5AohWXQ) on how to install the .NET SDK.
- Python: [python](https://www.python.org/downloads). Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/NES0LRUFMBE?si=UbPPznJs536YZHjn) on how to install python.

I recommend installing VS Code and the necessary extensions for C/C++, C#, Java, and Python. This will make it easier to view, edit, and run code on a single "unified" platform. Click [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to download and install VS Code.
