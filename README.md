# Programming Concepts for Computer Science and Software Engineering

Welcome to **Programming Concepts for Computer Science and Software Engineering**!

This repository is a collection of notes, code examples, and exercises I created while studying core software engineering and computer science concepts.

## Why This Repo Exists

After years of learning programming languages directly, I realized that focusing solely on syntax wasn’t the most effective way to grow as a software engineer. I discovered that understanding **concepts** — and applying those concepts using different languages — is what builds true engineering skill.

This repo exists to:
- Document and deepen my understanding of foundational programming concepts.
- Compare implementations across multiple languages (C, C++, C#, Java, Python).
- Serve as a personal knowledge base and portfolio of my journey toward becoming a better software engineer.

Remember: **Programming languages are merely tools** — it’s the underlying concepts and how we apply them that truly matter.

## 💻 Languages Used

Concepts will be demonstrated in multiple programming languages to illustrate differences and similarities:

- **C** – for low-level memory management and system programming.
- **C++** – for object-oriented and systems-level concepts.
- **C#** – for .NET-specific patterns and modern OOP features.
- **Java** – for enterprise-level patterns and strong OOP.
- **Python** – for rapid prototyping and scripting.

## 🚀 Contribution Guidelines

Right now, this repo is my personal learning project. However:
- Suggestions, issues, or feedback are welcome through GitHub Issues.
- Feel free to fork the repo if you’d like to explore these concepts yourself.
- If you’re interested in contributing code examples in other languages or improvements to existing ones, open a pull request — just make sure your code is well-documented and includes a README explaining your implementation.
